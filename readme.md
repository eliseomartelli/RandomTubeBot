2. [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

##### Second things second
Hey, you're kinda ready!

Clone this repo and create a file named ```keys.js``` inside the repo's root, then open it in your text editor, and put this in your file:
```js
module.exports = {
    telegramKey : "<YOUR TELEGRAM API KEY HERE>",
    youtubeKey : "<YOUR YOUTUBE API KEY HERE>"
};

```
Remember to change the strings with your own keys ðŸ˜Ž.
